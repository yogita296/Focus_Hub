# Focus_Hub
Focus Hub is a unified workspace where email and calendar work together instead of living as separate tools. The goal is to help users stay focused on what matters today, not just manage messages or meetings.

Focus Hub is a unified email and calendar experience designed around attention. In our design, emails and meetings are not separate tools but part of the same workflow. Emails that lead to meetings are automatically synced with the calendar, and meetings always retain their related conversations. This helps users understand what needs attention now, how their time is structured, and reduces the stress of switching between inboxes and schedules. The result is a calmer, more focused communication workspace.
