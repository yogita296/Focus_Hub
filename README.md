🧠 Focus Hub

Focus Hub is a unified workspace where 📧 email and 📅 calendar work as one—so you can focus on what matters today, not just manage messages or meetings.

Instead of treating email and scheduling as separate tools, Focus Hub is designed around 🧩 attention and flow. Emails that lead to meetings are automatically connected to your calendar, and every meeting keeps its related conversations attached. No context switching. No hunting for details.

With Focus Hub, you always know:

🎯 What needs your attention right now
🕒 How your time is structured today
💬 Why a meeting exists and what led to it

By reducing friction between inboxes and schedules, Focus Hub creates a 🌿 calmer, more intentional communication experience—helping you stay focused, not overwhelmed.
